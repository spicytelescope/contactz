# Contactz

> A small app meant to test a Vue SPA with PWA support.

## Features 

Contactz's aim is to show off some contact's card (which are fakes), add and remove some from a centralised firebase db.
Anyone can add his own contact's card, a "Contactz" !

For the security concerns, the DB's URL is visible as the collection is meant to be public. 
*This app is basically a POC for web's skills.*

Feel free to contact me if you've got any questions. Hope you **enjoy** !
